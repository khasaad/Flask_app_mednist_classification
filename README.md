<h3>Key words: Application, Flask, Python, Classification of medical images</h3>
<p>One of the tasks required in this project is to improve an application written using Pytorch and Flask where the user can add a single image in the application interface and get the prediction result and display it in the interface.</p>

<p>The required task is to add functionality that allows selecting a set of images, displaying them in the interface and sorting them into the appropriate folder using the improved template.</p>

<p>When we choose several images (for example 3 images), the result is displayed horizontally in the interface.</p>
